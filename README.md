  Maison De Lune

  Home Assistant Configuration
</h1>

This repo contains the working [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration for **Maison De Lune**. Below are links to the devices currently being used, blog posts, and other HA enthusists that provided inspiration and configs to help build this config. All of the code is free to use.

Be sure to follow me on twitter [@thejeffreystone](https://twitter.com/thejeffreystone) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipZJ6748kd8TbelSxcvcVg) where I am starting to post videos of my Home Automation journey. I also post articles about this config and other Home Automation topics at [slacker-labs.com](https://slacker-labs.com)

And of course, if you have hit that :star: at the top to follow this repo what are you waiting for? You can get updates right in your notification feed everytime I push updates. Which is at least once a week and some weeks quite a bit more.  

#### Maison De Lune's Three Laws of Home Automation 

When designing Maison De Lune's automations I have made every effort to prioritize the solution based on the following three laws. 

**First Law: Every automation or action should be the result of a passive sensor or indirect action**.

**Second Law: An automation can be triggered by voice command only when Law 1 cannot be achieved**.

**Third Law: An automation or action can be trigger by a physical switch or as the result of a direct iteraction only when Law 1 and Law 2 cannot be achieved.**

For more about how they are used visit [https://slacker-labs.com/2020/04/02/the-three-laws-of-home-automation/](https://slacker-labs.com/2020/04/02/the-three-laws-of-home-automation/)

This is V6 of my config.

#### General Information about Maison De Lune

Hassio is the flavor of Home Assistant powering Maison De Lune these days. Currently it is running on a Home Assistant Blue. 

The old configurations is stored in a different repo - [Older Version](https://github.com/thejeffreystone/home-assistant-configuration)

Read about the continuing work to automate **everything** over on [slacker-labs.com](https://slacker-labs.com). Feel free to reach out if you have questions. I love this stuff. 

One last thing. Everything in this configuration is a combination of the things I want out of a home automation system flavored with the inspiration from others using Home Assistant. In some cases I took someone else's idea and made it my own, and in some I just completely stole it. So I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge those that inpired this journey. If you like what you see here, please checkout their configs as well. I owe them thanks for sharing their work.
